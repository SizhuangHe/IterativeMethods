This folder contains implementation of traditional GCNs (as in [PyGCN](https://github.com/tkipf/pygcn)) and also implementation of iterative GCN.<br>
The experiments.ipynb files contains some simple experiment results and models.py contain implementation of the models, including iterative GCN models.<br>
Some experiments tried:
- 2 layer GCN
- 3 layer GCN
- single layer GCN with 2 iteration
- single layer GCN with 3 iteration
- take the trained single layer GCN with 2 iteration as above to do inference for 1 to 100 iterations
- take the trained single layer GCN with 3 iteration as above to do inference for 1 to 100 iterations
